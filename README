These are scripts for generating lightning NOx input files for CMAQv5.0.


If you have the NLDN dataset and need to build monthly average strike density

1. Build the program base/src/NLDN_2D using Makefile.NLDN_2D. This
does not require the most up to date version of IOAPI.

2. Run base/run.NLDN_2D.sh

3. Copy the output to base/flash_data/monthly_flash_density


If you have the NLDN gridded monthly average strike density and need
to build the parameter file for CMAQv5.0 (ocean mask, ICCG, and NLDN
adjustment factors):

1. Build the program base/src/LTNG_2D_DATA. This requires IOAPI 3.1.

2. Run base/run.LTNG_2D.sh

3. Compare files in R-out and output against the results in the verify
   directory
